# IR-Controlled-Robot-with-Obstacle-detection

This is a personal project I made to practice embedded systems concepts. 

This is a robot that can be remotely controlled by using IR remote and sensor. 

It also has an object detection algorithm that moves the robot automatically and avoids the objects if it's being detected close.
