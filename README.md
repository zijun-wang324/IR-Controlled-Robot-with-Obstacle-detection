# IR-Controlled-Robot-with-Obstacle-detection

This is a personal project I made to practice embedded systems concepts. 

This is a robot that can be remotely controlled by using IR remote and sensor. 

It also has an object detection algorithm that moves the robot automatically and avoids the objects if it's being detected close.

Here are the components needed:

1. Arduino MEGA 2560
2. 2 H-bridge Motor Driver(L293D)
3. 1 IR Sensor
4. 4 DC Motors
5. External Battery Supply
6. 2 LEDs to show which mode the robot is in
7. 1 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with 4 pins. 

The picture below is the schematic diagram of this project. 
In the diagram, it uses 9V battery but in the video for the demonstration, I used more batteries to move the DC motors. 
I also used the VEX Robotic parts and DC motors from the VEX robotics.
